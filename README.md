Builder's Inventory
===================
Builder's Inventory is a mod that adds a few inventory-related features to creative mode that I think are helpful for creating.  
This mod tries its best to be compatible with any random mod, but please report any issues you find!

Features
--------
- Hotbar Swapper
    - Allows you to swap your hotbar row with another row of items in your inventory
    - Also can swap with just 1 slot (column) rather than the full row of items
    - Pressing an inventory slot key (1-9) will quickly swap
    - Includes extended inventory
    - Default Keybinds are:
        - Full Row Swap = Mouse 5 (forwards side button)
        - Single Column Swap = Left Alt
- Extended Inventory
    - Basically a large client-sided enderchest
    - Saved to your files (`config/builders_inventory/...`) and persists across servers and worlds
    - Great for collecting, saving, and organizing cool items you find!
    - Has multiple pages for unlimited storage space!
    - Pages can be renamed, reordered, deleted
    - Pages can be locked to prevent editing and function like a custom creative tab!
    - Button in inventory or Hotkey (Default R) can be used to open it
- Operator Items Tab Force
    - Removes the operator requirement to see the tab.
    - Restricting this tab like that is inconvenient at best, as there are plenty of other ways to get the items anyways, and the items still cannot be used for harm.
    - (You still need to enable the tab in controls)

Config
------
This mod is decently configurable, from tweaking the behavior of hotbar swap hotkeys to disabling the extended inventory and more, so make sure to check the config out!

 Disclaimer
-----------
While this mod is generally harmless and only functions in creative mode, it's probably best to check on the rules of any server just to make sure. Particularly the hotbar swapper could be classified and/or detected as cheating. This is not me branding this as a cheat/hack mod, that is not my intent when making this, but I just don't want anyone getting banned from a creative server with excessively strict rules for using my mod.
